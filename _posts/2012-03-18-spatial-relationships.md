We ([goodold.se](http://goodold.se)) recently moved to a new office space. The new place is really amazing. However, there is one tiny detail that annoys the hell out of me; one has to perform advanced gymnastics to reach the toilet paper.

Now, I know you didn't come here to read about my toilet adventures. But somehow this got me thinking.

> It's baffling to me how architects still haven't figured out that the spatial relation between toilet and paper is important.

What's relevant though, is that even seemingly unimportant decisions matter. It does not matter that you're designing a gigantic building complex, the decision to place the toilet paper in an inconvinient place affects me first hand everyday. It's a tiny, silly thing to get annoyed by. But that's how it is. This notion is important to remember when we design software as well.

Don't make your users work hard to achieve results. Make everyday tasks as simple and painless as possible. Even the smallest thing can get annoying.

Don't justify ignoring small things with _"in the end it won't matter anyway"_. It probably _will_.
